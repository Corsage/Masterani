# Masterani
A good(?) android app to watch anime.

# Credits
This project could not be done without [Masterani.me](https://www.masterani.me). At the end of the day, all the information in the app is from them.  
  
Only thing I've done is create a simple Node.js server that takes episode links and properly formats them/scrapes the direct link if applicable.  
  
Example JSON response from the server:
  
`xd`

## About
I Made this because there aren't any great anime apps avaliable to the public. Also, this was the perfect opportunity to try out Kotlin so I had a lot of fun with this.

###### Criticism is highly encouraged, as said, this is my first time with Kotlin, so many things are probably not done as well as it should've been.
